    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <div class="bodytext">
        Hello and welcome to the home of <em><strong>IMPS</strong>: A Simplified Adventure System</em>! <strong>IMPS</strong> is a flexible, modular, lightweight, and setting-agnostic framework for playing a wide variety of roleplaying and narrative games. Though it was primarily designed for tabletop roleplaying, <strong>IMPS</strong> is easily adaptable to other forms of collaborative storytelling, such as interactive flowchart-based online games, and other roleplaying games, including those that do not traditionally use dice, character sheets, or fantastical settings. Likewise, all of the elements of <strong>IMPS</strong> are designed to plug-and-play into the system, meaning that the framework is deeply customizable. The creator and curator of <strong>IMPS</strong>, Kyle Eveleth, encourages fans of the system to produce their own modules, adventures, and settings utilizing the system with attribution.
        <br><br>
        On this site you'll find a variety of supplemental material designed to help you play <strong>IMPS</strong>. These include a dice rolling page, a fancy-schmancy random item generator (based on Module 2), and links to the rule sets if you need to replace (or purchase) a copy.
        <br><br>Thanks for stopping by. Don't hesitate to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> if you need support with anything found on this website.
        <h3>Cheers,</h3>
        Kyle Eveleth, PhD -- Creator of <strong>IMPS</strong>
